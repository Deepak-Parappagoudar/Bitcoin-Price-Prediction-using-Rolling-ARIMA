# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-Rolling-ARIMA


This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a short-term Bitcoin price prediction model based on the Rolling ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series analysis method.


# Overview
Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has witnessed significant price volatility since its inception. Predicting its price accurately is crucial for traders, investors, and researchers. The Rolling ARIMA model is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, and this repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement it for Bitcoin price prediction.
